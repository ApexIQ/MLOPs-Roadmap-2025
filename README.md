# **MLOps Roadmap 2025: Build Production-Ready AI Systems**

Here's the roadmap of MLOPs - https://whimsical.com/mlops-roadmap-2025-9hVyxpQHWBNGEXKP7AthdE

This roadmap helps you **master MLOps** — the art of taking machine learning models from "working locally" to "**serving millions safely**."

You'll learn everything from **pipelines**, **monitoring**, **drift detection**, **retraining**, **cloud MLOps**, **responsible AI**, and much more — **step-by-step**.

👉 Perfect for:
- Aspiring **ML Engineers**  
- **Data Scientists** leveling up to production  
- **MLOps enthusiasts** building real-world projects

| [Phase 3](./Documents/Phase-3.md) | 🧪 Experiment Tracking & Model Management | Track experiments systematically. Compare runs, metrics, and manage model registries. |
| [Phase 4](./Documents/Phase-4.md) | 🛠️ Workflow Orchestration & Pipelines | Build automated, scalable pipelines with Airflow, Prefect, and Kubeflow Pipelines. |
| [Phase 5](./Documents/Phase-5.md) | 🚀 Model Packaging, Deployment & Serving | Package models, build REST APIs, deploy containers, and serve models at scale. |
| [Phase 6](./Documents/Phase-6.md) | 🛡️ Monitoring, Drift Detection & Retraining | Monitor models, detect data drift, automate retraining, and ensure reliability. |
| [Phase 7](./Documents/Phase-7.md) | 🤝 Responsible AI & Governance | Fairness, bias audits, explainability, privacy, and compliance in AI systems. |
| [Phase 8](./Documents/Phase-8.md) | ☁️ Platform-Specific MLOps (Azure & GCP) | Master Azure ML, GCP Vertex AI, and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for scaling. |
| [Phase 9](./Documents/Phase-9.md) | 🎯 Capstone Projects & Industry Case Studies | Apply your skills with full real-world projects and learn from big tech companies' MLOps setups. |

## 🚀 **What You'll Learn by the End**

✔️ Build production-grade ML pipelines  
✔️ Automate training, validation, and deployment workflows  
✔️ Track and version experiments, models, and data  
✔️ Serve ML models via scalable APIs and containers  
✔️ Detect drift and automatically retrain models  
✔️ Implement Responsible AI practices: fairness, privacy, governance  
✔️ Deploy MLOps systems on Azure, GCP, or hybrid environments  
✔️ Deliver professional-grade MLOps capstone projects!


## 🧰 **Tools & Ecosystem You'll Work With**

| Area | Tools & Platforms |
|:---|:---|
| Versioning | Git, DVC, LakeFS |
| Experiment Tracking | MLflow, Weights & Biases (W&B) |
| Pipelines & Orchestration | Airflow, Prefect, Kubeflow Pipelines |
| Packaging & Serving | Docker, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe |
| Monitoring & Drift Detection | Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently AI |
| Responsible AI | Fairlearn, AIF360, SHAP, LIME |
| Cloud MLOps | Azure ML, Vertex AI |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform, Bicep, Deployment Manager |

## 🎯 **Capstone Challenge: Your Production ML System**

By the final phase, you'll independently design, build, and deploy a real-world project, covering:

✅ Data ingestion + versioning  
✅ Training pipelines + experiment tracking  
✅ Packaging + API serving (Docker, FastAPI)  
✅ Monitoring + drift detection systems  
✅ Retraining workflows  
✅ Documentation + live demos (optional but recommended!)

> **Pro Tip:** Pick a domain you love — Healthcare, Finance, NLP, Vision, Retail... and go deep!

## 🔥 **Bonus: Industry Case Studies (Real-World Inspiration)**

Learn how the world’s best companies scale AI with MLOps:
- **Airbnb** ➔ Metadata and data lineage systems
- **Uber (Michelangelo)** ➔ Scalable model training and serving
- **Netflix** ➔ Feature stores and real-time personalization
- **Spotify** ➔ ML pipelines for recommendations at scale
- **Google (TFX)** ➔ Modular production ML pipelines
- **LinkedIn** ➔ Safe model rollouts, A/B testing at infrastructure level

## 🧠 **How to Get the Best from This Roadmap**

- ✅ Follow the phases sequentially
- ✅ Work on mini-projects at each phase
- ✅ Complete your capstone alongside learning
- ✅ Document your process heavily (README, architecture diagrams, model cards)
- ✅ Share demos, blogs, or GitHub projects publicly
- ✅ Constantly monitor emerging tools and updates

## ✨ **Final Thought**

> **"A model that lives only in a notebook is NOT a machine learning product."**

MLOps is how you turn models into **real, reliable, impact-driven systems**.  
Master this — and you become the bridge between **data science** and **real-world AI deployments**.

# 🚀 **Ready?**
Let’s build systems that don’t just predict — but **work**, **scale**, and **impact** millions.  
**Star ⭐ this repo, share it, and let's shape the future of MLOps together!**
