# üìò **Phase 6: Monitoring, Drift Detection & Retraining**

## üéØ **Phase Objective**
Learn how to monitor models and data in production, detect drift early, build retraining workflows, and establish feedback loops to ensure continuous model health and performance.

## üß† **Topics to Cover**

### **What to Monitor in Production ML**

- Model Performance Metrics:
  - Track prediction quality: **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **AUC**, **loss**.
  - Monitor response time/latency for real-time systems.
- Data Input Distribution:
  - Monitor schema consistency (feature presence, types).
  - Watch for value drifts, missing values, or new/unseen categories.
- Infrastructure Health:
  - Monitor **CPU**, **GPU**, **memory usage**, **disk space**, **API response times**.
- User Behavior Metrics:
  - Capture user feedback: clicks, corrections, abandonments.
  - Use engagement metrics to infer prediction quality indirectly.

### **Data & Model Drift Detection**

- Understand **Drift** Types:
  - **Data Drift**: Distribution of input features changes (e.g., customers now submit different types of queries).
  - **Concept Drift**: Relationship between input and output changes (e.g., user buying behavior shifts).
- Common Causes of Drift:
  - Seasonality or trends
  - Business logic/product updates
  - Bugs or upstream data pipeline changes
- Drift Detection Tools:
  - **Evidently AI**: Dashboards and reports for data drift.
  - **WhyLabs**: Managed monitoring platform for ML models.
  - **Alibi Detect**: Open-source library for statistical drift detection.
- Manual Drift Metrics:
  - **PSI (Population Stability Index)** for feature distribution shifts.
  - **KL Divergence** for probability distribution comparison.

### **Logging, Alerts & Monitoring Pipelines**

- Logging Essentials:
  - Log model inputs, outputs, and predictions.
  - Save contextual metadata for audits and explainability (e.g., request ID, timestamps).
- Monitoring Infrastructure and Models:
  - **Prometheus + Grafana**: Metrics scraping and dashboarding for infra and custom metrics.
  - **Sentry** or **custom error logs**: For capturing serving errors.
  - **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: For continuous logging of model evaluation metrics.
- Alerting Systems:
  - Trigger alerts on anomalies or SLA violations.
  - Integrate with **Slack**, **PagerDuty**, **Email notifications**.
  - Set thresholds for latency, error rates, drift scores.

### **Automating Retraining Pipelines**

- Retraining Triggers:
  - Detected drift scores crossing thresholds.
  - Time-based triggers (weekly, monthly retrains).
  - New labeled data availability.
  - Business KPI shifts (e.g., decline in click-through rate).
- Retraining Pipeline Setup:
  - Use orchestration tools (**Airflow**, **Prefect**) to schedule retraining.
  - Automate retraining ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí deployment pipelines.
- Continuous Training (CI/CT) Best Practices:
  - Always validate new models before production rollout.
  - Save all retraining logs, data snapshots, and evaluation reports.
  - Allow for rollback if retrained models underperform.

> *Students should design a basic retraining DAG in Airflow or Prefect.*

### **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback Loops**

- Why Real Feedback Matters:
  - Improves label quality for retraining.
  - Helps catch model errors not obvious in training data.
- Feedback Collection Techniques:
  - Capture explicit ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down).
  - Track corrections and re-queries.
  - Use passive signals like dwell time, engagement.
- Building Feedback Interfaces:
  - Create simple feedback forms using **Streamlit**, **Flask APIs**, **Google Forms**, or **Airtable**.
- Applying Feedback:
  - Use for label generation.
  - Active learning: Prioritize uncertain predictions for human review.
  - Fine-tuning or retraining with updated datasets.

### **Model Governance and Audit Trails**

- Importance of Auditability:
  - Critical for regulated industries (finance, healthcare).
  - Necessary for debugging, root cause analysis, compliance.
- What to Track:
  - **Data Versions**: Which dataset was used for training?
  - **Model Versions**: Exact model binary and hyperparameters.
  - **Infrastructure Versions**: Deployment environment details.
  - **Configuration Snapshots**: YAML/JSON configs captured at deployment.
- Reporting and Dashboards:
  - Generate time-stamped training reports.
  - Track model behavior trends over time.
  - Use tools that allow easy export/sharing of audit logs.
