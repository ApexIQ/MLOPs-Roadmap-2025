# ðŸ“˜ **Phase 9: Capstone Projects & Industry Case Studies**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase Objective**
Apply everything learned across the roadmap into **real-world, end-to-end MLOps projects** and study **industry-grade case studies** for practical understanding of MLOps at scale.

## ðŸ§  **Topics to Cover**

### **Choosing & Scoping Your Capstone Project**

- Select a domain for your project:
  - **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, imaging models, patient risk scoring.
  - **Finance**: Fraud detection, credit scoring, forecasting.
  - **Retail**: Customer segmentation, recommendation engines.
  - **Logistics**: Delivery time prediction, inventory forecasting.
  - **NLP**: Text summarization, chatbots, intent classification.
  - **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection.
  - **Time Series**: Anomaly detection, forecasting.
- Define project scope using a structured template:
  - **Business Goal**: What problem are you solving?
  - **Data Source**: Where is your data coming from (public datasets, synthetic, collected)?
  - **ML Approach**: Which ML models or techniques?
  - **Deployment Target**: Local server, cloud API, batch endpoint?
  - **Monitoring Plan**: How will you track model health after deployment?
- Output Expectations:
  - **GitHub repo** with well-documented code and clear README.
  - **Deployment** either locally, on Azure, or GCP.
  - **Governance Documentation** (optional bonus for Responsible AI layer).
  - **Bonus Deliverables**: Blog post, live demo app, or recorded presentation.


### **Full MLOps Implementation (End-to-End)**

Your capstone project must showcase the full MLOps lifecycle:
- **Data Ingestion + Versioning**:
  - Use tools like **DVC** or **LakeFS**.
- **Training Pipeline with Experiment Tracking**:
  - Implement using **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases (W&B)**.
- **Model Packaging and Serving**:
  - Package with **Docker**.
  - Serve with **FastAPI** (or Flask).
- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy locally or use cloud services like **Azure ML** or **Vertex AI**.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**:
  - Set up using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Evidently AI**.
- **Retraining Loop or Drift Response**:
  - Build mechanisms to retrain or adjust if model performance degrades.
- **Optional (Recommended)**: Responsible AI Integration
  - Bias audit, explainability reports (e.g., SHAP, Model Cards).

> *Students should treat the project as if they are productionizing a real ML product.*


### **Documenting Your Project Like a Pro**

- **README File**:
  - Explain the project goal, dataset, model choice, deployment plan.
  - Clear setup instructions for local and cloud deployment.
- **System Architecture Diagram**:
  - Draw data flow and component interactions using **Mermaid.js** or **Draw.io**.
- **Model Cards & Dataset Cards**:
  - Create lightweight documentation explaining model behaviors, intended use, data properties.
- **Demo Links**:
  - Host live apps on **Streamlit Cloud**, **Hugging Face Spaces**, or simple Docker servers.
  - Provide video walkthroughs if possible.

### **Industry MLOps Case Studies**

Study how leading companies implement MLOps at scale:
- **Airbnb**:
  - Full end-to-end data lineage tracking and metadata management for ML models.
- **Uber (Michelangelo Platform)**:
  - Internal platform enabling retraining, serving, and monitoring ML models at scale.
- **Netflix**:
  - Advanced feature stores and multi-region model deployment for fast personalization.
- **Spotify**:
  - Strong focus on ML-driven personalization using scalable, robust data pipelines.
- **Google (TensorFlow Extended - TFX)**:
  - Modular, standardized ML pipelines using Kubeflow Pipelines and TFX components.
- **LinkedIn**:
  - A/B testing infrastructure with model validation and safe rollbacks before scaling.

> *Students should pick one case study and write a short 1-page summary of learnings.*

### **Suggested Stack (Sample)**

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Data Versioning | DVC, LakeFS |
| Experiment Tracking | MLflow, Weights & Biases (W&B) |
| Pipeline Orchestration | Apache Airflow, Prefect |
| Model Packaging | Docker, ONNX |
| Serving | FastAPI, Flask, Vertex AI, Azure ML |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently AI |
| Reporting & Explainability | SHAP, Model Cards, Markdown Docs, Streamlit Apps |

> Students should customize their tool choices based on project requirements.


## âœ… **Phase Completion Goals**

At the end of Phase 9, students should:
- Complete an end-to-end MLOps capstone project, from data to deployment to monitoring.
- Build professional documentation, dashboards, and governance artifacts.
- Understand how industry MLOps systems are designed and operated at scale.
- Be ready to showcase their project to employers, peers, or for portfolio building.
