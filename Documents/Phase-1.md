# üìò **Phase 1: Foundations of MLOps & the ML Lifecycle**

## üéØ **Phase Objective**  
Understand the need for MLOps, how it fits into the machine learning lifecycle, team roles, maturity levels, and master the basics of version control for ML workflows.

## üß† **Topics to Cover**

### **What is MLOps?**

- Understand the core problems with deploying ML models:
  - Lack of reproducibility
  - Environment inconsistencies
  - Model performance decay without monitoring
- Compare MLOps vs DevOps vs DataOps:
  - MLOps handles not only code, but also **data**, **models**, **metrics**, and **pipelines**.
  - DevOps focuses on **software code** only.
  - DataOps focuses on **managing and delivering data pipelines**.
- Learn the key benefits of MLOps:
  - **Reproducibility** of experiments and deployments
  - **Efficiency** in retraining and deployment
  - **Scalability** for team collaboration and large-scale ops
  - **Automation** to reduce manual errors

### **Machine Learning Lifecycle**

- Learn each stage in the ML lifecycle:
  - **Data Collection** ‚Üí **Preprocessing** ‚Üí **Modeling** ‚Üí **Evaluation** ‚Üí **Deployment** ‚Üí **Monitoring** ‚Üí **Retraining**
- Understand the difference between ML and software cycles:
  - ML needs constant feedback loops (new data ‚Üí retraining).
  - Software development is usually a linear flow.
- Study real-world ML challenges:
  - **Model Drift** (model performance decays over time)
  - **Hidden Biases** in new data
  - **Stale Features** (input data features change over time)
- Understand how handoffs occur between teams:
  - **Data Scientists** ‚Üí develop models
  - **ML Engineers** ‚Üí prepare production-ready models
  - **Platform Engineers / DevOps** ‚Üí deploy and monitor

### **MLOps Roles & Teams**

- Learn about key roles involved in MLOps:
  - **ML Engineer**: builds and productionizes models
  - **Data Scientist**: analyzes data and experiments with models
  - **MLOps Engineer**: focuses on automation, pipelines, monitoring
  - **DevOps Engineer**: focuses on infrastructure and deployments
  - **Product Manager**: defines requirements aligning business needs with ML solutions
- Study collaboration models:
  - **Centralized teams**: A single MLOps team supports many ML teams
  - **Federated teams**: Every ML team manages its own ops
  - **Platform model**: Central infra team, individual ML teams handle models
- Understand how team workflows are divided:
  - Handoffs between **data preparation**, **model training**, **deployment**, and **monitoring**
  - Importance of **cross-functional communication** (especially for retraining and monitoring feedback)

### **MLOps Maturity Levels (Google, Azure Models)**

- Learn the 3 standard maturity levels in MLOps evolution:
  - **Level 0: Manual Process**
    - Manual training in notebooks
    - No versioning or pipeline automation
  - **Level 1: ML with CI/CD Pipelines**
    - Automated data preprocessing and model training
    - Version control for data, code, and models
  - **Level 2: Fully Automated MLOps**
    - Automatic drift detection
    - Triggered retraining and redeployment
    - Auto rollback on failures
- Study different maturity evaluation frameworks:
  - **Google MLOps Paper** (Levels 0/1/2 explained)
  - **Azure ML Lifecycle Framework** (Operational maturity)

> *Students should assess real-world ML projects and guess their MLOps level.*

### **Version Control for ML Projects**

- Understand why Git is critical for MLOps:
  - Tracks code changes
  - Enables collaboration
  - Links models to specific experiments
- Learn basic Git operations:
  - Clone, commit, push, pull, branching
- Know how Git can be extended to manage:
  - Code + datasets + models
- Learn about DVC (Data Version Control):
  - Tracks large datasets outside of Git (e.g., S3, GCS)
  - Allows "versioning" of data like Git versions code
- Study how Git + DVC can ensure reproducible ML experiments:
  - **Data** and **model binaries** are connected with **code commits**.

## ‚úÖ **Phase Completion Goals**

At the end of Phase 1, students should:
- Clearly explain why MLOps is necessary in real ML systems
- Understand how ML workflows are structured differently from software
- Identify key team roles and how they collaborate
- Evaluate the maturity level of any ML project
- Use Git (and optionally DVC) to version datasets, models, and code
